# FirstStaticPortfolio
This is my first static onlive CV.

I have created this web site http://www.anastasios-arvanitis.info to host my CV and my online portfolio, but of course to excercise too.
It's written in html5, css3 and jquery. I will mention again that learning jquery was important beacause it helped realise that I should learn Reactjs :) Feel free to let me your comments!
